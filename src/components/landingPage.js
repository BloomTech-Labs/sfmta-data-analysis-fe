     <h1>Problem</h1>

    The SFMTA has no publicly available historical data to determine the travel (both actual and average) times on muni bus and rail lines. This prevents Muni employees, citizens, and elected officials from understanding the root cause of performance problems. Realtime data is available, via (http://restbus.info/api/agencies/sf-muni/), but this data is not saved for historical analysis. Historical analysis of bus and rail location data would be an effective means to determine the root cause of bunches and gaps in the Muni service. A bunch is when a bus or rail car bunches up together while a gap is longer than the normal wait between a bus or rail car.
    
   <h1>Mission</h1>
    
    The mission of this project is to have a publicly available, historical look at the SFMTA's bus and rail locations so that citizens, oversight committee members, and SFMTA staff can determine what impacts Muni service so that intelligent decisions can be made on where to put resources.
